# godot_curve_editor
Gdscript clone of the Godot Engine Curve Editor to use in Tool Scripts etc

For some reason you can't use the engine built in curve editor as a UI element. I've mainly copied the existing functionality over to Gdscript to allow it to be used anywhere.

There's a couple of kinks to work out, but I'm publishing this here until I can get some time to clean it up and publish it as a proper addon.

Please submit an issue or publish a PR if you find anything that needs fixing.
